If you're going to run the game in debug, you will need a copy of the meiryo.ttc file. You can usually just find this in your Windows system files, Fonts folder.

You probably can run the game with a different font set, but I haven't ever tested anything beyond meiryo, and since this was my first project ever, it wasn't written to be super robust out of naivety.
