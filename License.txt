I am releasing the source code of JivenJive to allow others to read and come to their own conclusions about what's good or bad about this source to hopefully improve their own ability.

If you want to use any part of the source code, or use any documents that are included in the repo, you must credit me, Andrew N Reinke, as the original author of the source code, or any other document(s).

One particular thing, is that if you want to use the JivenJivelogo.png in something, please contact me!
