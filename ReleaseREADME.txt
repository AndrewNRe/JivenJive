Thank you very much for downloading my game! I hope you get something out of it!

Here's the controls-
spacebar / left mouse = activate hand
esc / middle mouse = settings

If you activate the "hand", your mic input will influence the mask in different ways while it is active!

If the game doesn't run on your machine, please report the issue to my twitter (@AndrewNReinke), or comment on the itch page!
