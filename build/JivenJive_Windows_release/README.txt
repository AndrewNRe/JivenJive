Thank you very much for downloading my game! I hope you get something out of it!

Here's the controls-
spacebar  left mouse = activate hand
esc  middle mouse = settings

If you activate the hand, your mic input will influence the mask in different ways while it is active!

If the game doesn't run on your machine, please report the issue to my twitter (@AndrewNReinke), or email me at andrewnereinke@gmail.com, or comment on the itch page!
